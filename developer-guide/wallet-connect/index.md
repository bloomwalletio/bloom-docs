# WalletConnect

To be able to connect with the IOTA / Shimmer ecosystem, Bloom implements `WalletConnect`(ref: https://docs.walletconnect.com/quickstart). WalletConnect is a generic interface, which offers the user the freedom to connect their trusted wallet to the dApp.

If you're a dApp developer and plan to implement `WalletConnect` into your dApp, checkout https://docs.walletconnect.com/web3modal/about.
