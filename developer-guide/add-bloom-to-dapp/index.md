# Add Bloom to your DApp

To be able to connect with the IOTA / Shimmer ecosystem, Bloom implements `WalletConnect`(ref: https://docs.walletconnect.com/quickstart). WalletConnect is a generic interface, which offers the user the freedom to connect any of  their trusted wallets to the dApp.

If you're a dApp developer and want your users to use `Bloom` together with your dApp, checkout the following guides for your frameworks:

[Web3Modal (Recommended)](web3modal.md)  
[RainbowKit](rainbow-kit.md)  
[ConnectKit](connect-kit.md)  
[Wagmi](wagmi.md)


If your framework of choice isn't listed here, feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RjX3jEc7K7) and we will gladly assist you.
