Because Bloom stores all NFT media locally, it is recommended to set a upper limit for the media size, so that they don't take up too much space on your computer. If an NFT isn't downloaded because of this setting, you're still able to see the NFT by using the Open media in browser button."]},{"l":"Refresh NFT media","p":["Sometimes it can happen that NFT media is downloaded incorrectly.
