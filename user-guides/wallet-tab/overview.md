### 2. Account Menu

The Account menu allows you to provide actions related to your currently selected account. These are:

- Syncing accounts: a feature to find missing balances on higher address indices. *Mostly used for IOTA/Shimmer users that have been using Firefly v1.*
- Balance breakdown: a breakdown that shows you the allocation of your funds. It also includes a pop-up that allows you to consolidate your balance. Consolidation means to reduce your amount of outputs to free up storage deposit.
- Customise account: a pop-up that allows you to change your account name and the associated color.
- Hide/Unhide account: this option hides your account from the account switcher. You can show hidden accounts by enabling the hidden accounts setting in the Advanced Section of settings. By enabling this option, you can click this option to unhide the account.
- Delete account: removes your account from your profile. You can restore it using the wallet finder. *This option is not available for the first account.*
